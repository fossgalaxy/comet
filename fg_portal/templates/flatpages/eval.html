Flatpages with evaluation.

This will allow evaluation of flatpages that include django template tags
and variables. In doing so it makes it possible to reference the user in
the template the same way you would in a django template.

This is useful for providing code templates that need to be customised for the
user. Be very careful with this, you can do some very bad things if you are not
EXTREMELY careful.
